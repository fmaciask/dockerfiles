I want to run bash scripts that "handles" docker-in-docker. So, before I jump into DIND, first, let's do some container that run bash script. Easy, now, I pass a folder that contains my scripts and I configure in Dockerfile an ARG so I can make a different image depending in the --build-arg. Example: I've got 2 scripts inside "files" directory inside the same folder where Dockerfile is stored. Using ARG and passing the --build-arg I can choose any of these 2 scripts and build an image that will run THAT script.
